languages used for this is python.
the working principle is simpel:
1) the url given is shortened to a new url by a function.
2) this url is sent to a server where it is redirected to the same url which you had entered.
3) these url are stored in the server file as dictionary which contains the values and keys as the corresponding actual url and the shortened url.
4)finally whenever you will enter  the short url in the browser it will send a request to the server to send back its actual url thus the browser redirects you to the actual url.
